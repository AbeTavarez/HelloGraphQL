@Notes on file server.js

1- We installed: express, express-graphql, graphql and lodash.

2- Initiated express and expressGraphQL :
// had to add .graphqlHTTP at the end in order to work correctly
const expressGraphQL = require('express-graphql').graphqlHTTP;
// this also works
const { graphqlHTTP } = require('express-graphql'); 

3- App middleware and Create route for '/graphql', setup expressGraphQL with
the schema and graphiql: true
